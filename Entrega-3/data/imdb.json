            "reviewBody": "Actually, I expected many things in the movie before it was released plus all the spots and trailers that hyped me so much. This movie has every Raimi&apos;s style, such as, great camera angles, editing, and color grading also the terrifying tone from every Raimi movie. Besides the great things in this movie, it carries bunch of wired dialogues and screenplay. There are lots of plot holes in this movie. In this movie, there are many elements that can be use in the further movies, but they just...like throw it in some bad ways I never understand. So as a MCU fan, this just make me disappointed so much. As I say without Raimi directing style, this will be even worse than this.",

The Northman feels just like a Eggers movie but with a bigger budget, and wow what a fantastic movie this was. A dark,brutal and Violent vikings tale with some incredibly beautiful shots and a Swedish viking in the lead role.\n\nThe Northman feelt like a crossover betweeen The Green Knight and Gladiator and it might already be one of the best movies of the year.",

            "name": "A Solid, Throwback Comedy",
            "reviewBody": "Mainstream comedies that actually make it to theatres are slim to none these days. I remember a time when there was possibly a big comedy coming out every one or two months, with at least half of them being good, but in today&apos;s climate, humour is just tough to get right. I was very happy to see that Paramount would be taking a chance and releasing a big comedy in The Lost City this year, but I truly didn&apos;t know to what to expect from it. After seeing it in theatres, I&apos;m happy to say that I had a good time with it. It&apos;s not great, but it felt like a throwback comedy, just with a modern twist.\n\nTo put it simply, The Lost City follows Loretta (Sandra Bullock) as she&apos;s on a book tour with her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) to promote the release of &quot;The Lost City of D,&quot; but they are swept up in a kidnapping and find themselves on a real adventure in the jungle. Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the reason Loretta was kidnapped in the first place, as he sees many similarities in her book to that of a real lost city. Being the privileged twerp that he is makes for a fun villainous storyline, even if it&apos;s pretty lame at times. Radcliffe aside (whom I still enjoyed), this film puts all of its weight on Tatum and Bullock to deliver the goods.\n\nThis premise is clever enough to work as a film, but it all comes down to who you cast and if they can make the material work. I never thought I needed to see this duo together, but I&apos;m very happy they worked so well. On top of that, I have to admit that the best moments in the film feature Brad Pitt&apos;s character Jack Trainer. He isn&apos;t in the film much, but every second he was on screen had me laughing. Where I found the film to be slightly uneven though, was in the fact that I wasn&apos;t sure if it wanted to be funny or dramatic at times.\n\nI&apos;m all for heartfelt storylines as well as comedy, but I would argue that the majority of the humour is in the first half, while the second half gets a little more sentimental. These both worked in the movie, but the way the film begins gives absolutely no foreshadowing as to what the film will become by the end. I found that odd, but again, the cast sold all of the dialogue for me. From a few hilarious moments to some fun adventure/action throughout, as I said, I had a good time with this one.\n\nIn the end, The Lost City is exactly what I think moviegoers need right now. Nothing too serious or weighed down by heavy drama. This is a good old-fashioned, silly comedy/romance that I feel works for what it is. It&apos;s not going to be the type of comedy that a lot of people are going to watch over and over again, at least I don&apos;t think, but the heart of the film is in the right place and it never takes anything too seriously. Now playing in theatres, I&apos;d give a recommendation to The Lost City.",

This is a movie that morphs from immigrant drama to sci fi to Kung Fu to comedy to existential art flick and back again. Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don&apos;t know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I&apos;m glad it exists. I lamented multiverse stories after the last MCU film, and I guess I have to take that back now. It is possible to tell wildly imaginative genre bending multiverse stories. You just don&apos;t need superheroes to do it (unless you count the Daniels).",

            "reviewBody": "Right, well this was a fully and wholly unnecessary remake of the 1984 movie of the same name.\n\nAs I stumbled upon this 2022 movie from writer Scott Teems and director Keith Thomas, I have to admit that my immediate thought was &apos;oh no, another unnecessary remake, just like the 2015 remake of &quot;Poltergeist&quot;&apos;. Yet I opted to sit down and watch the movie, and actually give director Keith Thomas a fair chance with this 2022 version of &quot;Firestarter&quot;.\n\nBut as I just said above, &quot;Firestarter&quot; was a very unnecessary remake, and if you have seen the 1984 classic with Drew Barrymore, David Keith, Heather Locklear, Martin Sheen and George C. Scott, then you can easily skip on the 2022 version, believe you me.\n\nSure, if you are unfamiliar with the 1984, then there is some entertainment value to the 2022 &quot;Firestarter&quot;, no doubt about it. But for us that have seen the original, then this movie was just water under the bridge.\n\nThe 2022 movie stars Zac Efron and Ryan Kiera Armstrong. I can&apos;t fathom why they opted for Efron for this movie, but Armstrong was actually nicely cast. The movie also have some good performances from veterans such as Kurtwood Smith, John Beasley, Gloria Reuben and Michael Greyeyes.\n\nVisually then &quot;Firestarter&quot; was nice, of course it was, given it is special effects and CGI made in 2022. But that doesn&apos;t alleviate the fact that &quot;Firestarter&quot; is a redundant movie.\n\nMy rating of this watered-down remake lands on a bland five out of ten stars.",

            "reviewBody": "36/100\n\nUncharted is Sony&apos;s latest attempt to fit an acclaimed franchise with 42 hours of content and story into just 2... Make your own judgment from that.\n\nIt&apos;s funny to think that, no matter how hard you try, these days you cannot adapt a video game into a film, and vice versa. While one tries to be as efficient as possible with his limited time, the other can pack as much information as it can in order to become more extensive or ambitious.\n\nThis indicates that, even if someone has the courage to adapt something like the Uncharted series to the big screen, whether they wanted to or not, they must summarize, or flatly ignore, certain plot points to prioritize others. The problem is that this selection process has such a complex naturalness that, with a single mistake, it can feel like the film is trying to contextualize as much as it can, ignoring not to feel overwhelming.\n\nEven if that is your purpose, you have to be subtle. Uncharted binned that advice completely.\n\nFrom European villains to straight up pirate ships, Uncharted feels like one of the least ambitious popcorn flicks I&apos;ve come across in quite some time.\n\nThe plot seems to have been invented while the filming process of the film was being executed, which would not surprise me at this point if it were true, while clinging to the mediocrity of the actors&apos; work. The same ones who clearly did not want to be part of the film in the first place.",

How could they translate the complexity of character and his true coolness but stay away from the cheeseball stuff? Dress a guy up like the books and remain true to the seriousness of the character? Well, they managed to not only pull it off but deliver one of the best hero origin films ever made.\n\nThe director knew that you had to establish and truly care about the character. Making it grounded but still trippy really helps give it a flavor unlike any other comic adaptation. The Harry Potter meets Iron Man meets Ant-Man flavor was there yet it all feels unique. The MCU magic is there literally. Everything established in the Captain America films and both Avengers pays dividends in a way here. The universe has been established wonderfully and this film does the best job to date playing in that universe. Everything and every scene packs some sort of punch and resonates with true style and heart. They really let the action flow but also allow for key development of the overall story and over concept. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character&apos;s personalities. ALL the characters even the ones with smaller roles get to shine. This heightens the tension, so often missing from lesser comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. Add more than a dash of thriller aspects and a few new characters that steal every scene that they appear in.\n\nI honestly can&apos;t think of one way to improve this film. The result is a movie that&apos;s just flat out exceptional and that honestly delivers the best visuals I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie."

            "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t remember if I have reviewed another movie so far, but seeing so many 10/10 reviews determined me to log in to write this, to ballance things up a bit.\n\nThe movie is pretty bad. The plot (if you can call it that) is mostly absurd and the events are cliche and totally predictable (try to remember what somebody did or said in all the bad movies that you ever saw: yes, it&apos;s exactly what&apos;s going to happen), the events don&apos;t make a lot of sense, the dialogue is cringe, the characters are very cartoonish and unbelievable. What they say don&apos;t make a lot of sense, and also nobody reacts to events in the way a normal person would do. These are comic book characters, not people. When they try to suggest some of these people are crime lords it&apos;s hilarious, you can&apos;t help but chuckle. Real mobsters would have these guys for breakfast. Ironically, the fly girls in the movie are actually more believable, because the way they live it is more close to some girls I know.\n\nI never saw any of the &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; movies, but for a good part it felt like a relative of those movies. The sex scenes are pretty convincing, I&apos;m still unsure if the oral sex was actually simulated or not.\n\nThe good things I can say about this are (and each gets a star from me): \n* the photography is pretty good, at least the cinematographer knew what he was doing\n* the actors are generally pretty easy on the eye, the costumes are also solid, there are nice and diverse locations, hence there is always something appealing to look at on the screen\n* the sex scenes are pretty good if you&apos;re into that kind of thing (I am)\n\n\nShould you see it? Well I don&apos;t know, even with the low score that I gave it, I feel like people should make up their own mind and not take someone&apos;s else opinion on it. Besides, I think people should watch bad movies from time to time, to be able to understand better why other movies are good, and to be more appreciative of those, as a consequence.\n\nSo yeah, go watch it, but keep your expectations ridiculously low.",

As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an &apos;elevated&apos; porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the &quot;Director&quot; even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).\n\nQuite consciously taking it&apos;s set up from Tobe Hooper&apos;s 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West&apos;s main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It&apos;s not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper&apos;s EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).\n\nThe movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the &quot;crew&quot; all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.\n\nAs good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it&apos;s commenting on, regardless of how well executed and &apos;elevated&apos; it thinks it is. It&apos;s also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it&apos;s elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren&apos;t sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.\n\nIn the end, it&apos;s not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it&apos;s simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride."

            "reviewBody": "The Bad Guys is definitely a step forward for Dreamworks, despite the fact that its script is quite predictable, the characters have a lot of charisma, that together with a more than excellent animation.\n\nIts soundtrack is also quite remarkable, a worthy job coming from Daniel Pemberton (Spider-Man Into The Spiderverse composer) this makes the chases and action scenes a visual delight.\n\nIn conclusion, The Bad Guys is a very good movie that hooks you throughout the movie, it is dynamic and frenetic, with a lesson in morality and emotional moments, It is not a masterpiece like other films from the studio, but if it is moderately successful, we could say that it is the new Dreamworks franchise. Hopefully they improve and refine what was done in this movie in a possible sequel or in other studio projects.",

Along the way, though, Mr. Wolf begins to suspect that doing good for real may give him what he&apos;s always secretly longed for: acceptance. So when a new villain threatens the city, can Mr. Wolf persuade the rest of the gang to become... The Good Guys?"

My opinion: you&apos;ve seen this story a hundred times, but never like this. Finally 3D is what it&apos;s supposed to be, an instrument at the service of the movie. You&apos;ll enjoy the visual experience, no doubt.\n\nAs for the story, some of the &quot;inspirations&quot; are so huge and so obvious that mentioning two or three of them would REALLY ruin the movie for you, and I&apos;m not willing to do that. Lots of mysticism and ecology, if you like that stuff. If you&apos;re 15 or so, you&apos;ll have a great time thinking that it&apos;s the first time somebody makes something like this. If you&apos;re an experienced movie watcher, better leave your skepticism at the door, bring lots of pop corn and enjoy with the usual action-flick-with-moral-and-loads-of-clichés.\n\nI liked it, however: &quot;the movie that re-invents movies&quot;???

Besides putting the film in a beautiful set piece on a boat and beautiful visual effects of the Nile river and Egypt setting.\n\nThe film does have a promising cast ensemble. Kenneth Branagh does great with the role. The newcomers like Annette Being, Russell Brand, Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Letitia Wright and many others are all talented.\n\nThe script drags the story. The direction is slow and boring. Every clue is revealed slowly, and when the twist is revealed. It is no surprise or giving you that thrill. I found the film to be boring and slow. The story is decent. The direction and script could have been so much better for a whodunit kind of film.",

            "reviewBody": "It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I should probably go to bed. It&apos;s late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.\n\nThis film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it&apos;s so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.\n\nBut it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it&apos;s not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter&apos;s wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.\n\nThe more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone&apos;s youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister&apos;s wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.\n\nInside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.\n\nThis is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.\n\nMost masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; or &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",

I gave it a 7 because I managed to get through it until the end, but I was never moved in the way I would like to be when watching a movie, and honestly, I could have just as easily given in a 6. So much could have been developed more - family dynamics, relationships, friendships. In short, watch this if you have nothing else to watch and you will probably feel a bit meh throughout.

It&apos;s ... grotesque.&quot;\n\nThe unbelievable part of The Unbelievable Weight of Immense Talent is that it&apos;s all true (in a figurative way). Nicolas Cage can play himself, Nick Cage, because the many films he&apos;s been in, some worthwhile (Moonstruck, Raising Arizona, Face/Off) and some terrible (take your pick), have prepared him for a true meta experience, like John Malkovich in Being John Malkovich or the cast playing themselves in Robert Altman&apos;s The Player.\n\nOf course, it&apos;s hilarious because Cage is usually a witty version of himself and making fun of himself anyway (except when he wins the Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas). With the help of director Tom Gormican and writer Kevin Etten, Unbearable is a metanarrative of Nick as a burgeoning hero for his daughter, Addy (Lily Sheen), and a buddy for a drug kingpin, Avi (Pedro Pascal), with whom he writes a joke thriller, which Unbearable turns out to be.\n\nPascal&apos;s performance as a thorough Cage fan and possible drug lord emphasizes the often-close emotional bond between fans, star, and film. There is little difference between us and Avi in our love for the actor and his roles.\n\nThroughout this comedy, the art of filmmaking turns out to take center screen as the principals dog out a workable script that they really are starring in here, more or less because the fusion of art and life is blurred. The varied facets of filmmaking and the actor&apos;s relationship with his audience are never far from the surface. Nor is it stagnant because each Cage film is a mirror for Hollywood&apos;s immediate needs and its actor&apos;s. In Unbearable Nick&apos;s striving for the &quot;part of a lifetime,&quot; never far from a cliché.\n\nFor Nicolas Cage, such is his life, and the film makes fun of his accepting roles solely for getting cash to pay his bills, and maybe, just maybe, for the joy of acting, for which he&apos;s indicted when he loses the people closest to him because of his obsession for acting.\n\nAs Cage plays himself, he stumbles on the right script to reconcile him with his family and win the admiration of his audience. He&apos;s never far from his Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas or a &quot;should-have-been-nominated&quot; in Pig. A good will pervades this complex comedy, largely because Cage has a good heart hidden underneath his thespian ambitions, real or fictional."

The kind of movie where the good guys are people that in the real world, you wouldn&apos;t want living next to you, or even sitting next to you on a bus or plane. Even with the great Johnny Depp, and a $5.50 seniors&apos; rate ticket , this movie was almost a total yawn. It was so bad,that the ushers requested that we leave our cell phones on.Or at least I wish."

I watched this film during a special premiere in Tallinn and it was way better than expected.\n\nThe only reason I bought a ticket was to see Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Jake Gyllenhal. There was really no expectation for me going in and then the LA scene started and it felt like I was watching a Bay Boys movies. I get that Bad Boys was based in Florida, but Michael Bay captured the same all-sun hot and fast vibe.\n\nThere is not much in terms of a coherent plot. But who cares at this point. You chose to watch a Michael Bay movie. It doesn&apos;t make sense? Well nothing by the director has made sense since the 90s. It is all explosive fun.\n\nIf you have seen enough Michael Bay movies by now you already know the dizzying circular shots are coming, same camera angles and clips are going to be repeated, but this is certainly one of Mr. Bay&apos;s watchable works.\n\nEven as you will be scratching your head why all this is happening the rapid pace just takes you. The best comp I have is Unstoppable starring Chris Pine and Denzel Washington. Not the same level of stakes or execution or suspense or great. But heart pounding nonetheless.\n\nIf you like Michael Bay&apos;s work, then give this a go. Others who may come in expecting bigger and better things, maybe stay away. This is a action vehicle (literally) so just enjoy it as one no need for a thinking cap on this one.",

            "reviewBody": "I have long waited to see this new attempt at turning Herbert&apos;s book into a movie. The ingredients sounded promising (Villeneue, Zimmer, cast, ...) as well as the praise the movie has received so far.\n\nTrying to immerse myself into the universe the film constructs, or better, translates from the book, I need to say for me there is something missing. I&apos;ve seen Lynch&apos;s adaptation, have read the book, and played the Dune games (esp. Dune 2) day and night in my teenage days. Maybe it is because of this background, that I felt empty during most of the runtime of the movie. The book is difficult to translate to the screen, depicting not only the political conflicts, but also the inner conflicts and motivations of its protagonists vividly.\n\nThe movie tries not to deviate too much from the book&apos;s storyline, which I have to give Villeneuve credit for. But in contrast to Blade Runner 2049, the movie runs quite flat on the emotional side. But as said, maybe because I already know what happens next, and have already immersed myself into the imaginative Dune universe countless times, I felt like I was in a half-dreaming state phantasizing these visuals, but not actually watching a captivating story.\n\nThere is little dialogue and another point of critique is Zimmer&apos;s work in this. Someone here wrote that he considers the Dune soundtrack Zimmer&apos;s magnum opus, but to me this was Interstellar (2014). The score in Blade Runner 2049 was already quite minimalistic, but I credit Zimmer for at least using the CS80 like Vangelis did, thereby finding the right sounds for the futuristic setting. But here, in Dune, there is even more absence of any theme/leitmotifs, it&apos;s just a combination of a few chords and drones which sometime do not match the film&apos;s flow, with some occasional ethnic vocals which are absolutely over the top. It feels like Zimmer tried hard to find the right music for this movie, but in the end, delivered something absolutely generic that a young aspiring composer would probably be ashamed of.\n\nNevertheless I think I can recommend watching the movie, especially for people who have not read the book. I hope Villeneuve will be able to deliver the second (and third?) part, because probably it will turn out that the movie was deliberately filmed in the style of a two hour long prologue.\n\nJust do not expect too much; I think the praise that the movie has received on its own is a bit too much for the actual product, but in the end, let&apos;s see where this franchise goes, probably this Dune will be the perfect movie if seen as a part of a trilogy.",

            "reviewBody": "Downton Abbey: A New Era is the sequel to the first Downton Abbey movie from 2019. This sequel is directed by Simon Curtis, the director of Goodbye Christopher Robin and My Week with Marilyn. In the film, the Crawley family learns that Violet Crawley (Maggie Smith) has inherited a French villa. Some of the family therefore travel to France to view the villa. Here they learn about Violet&apos;s past and discover things she&apos;s been hiding.\n\nThe rest of the family stays in Britain at their manor and estate. Where to repair damage to the mansion, young relatives have agreed to a deal from filmmakers who want to use the mansion and estate in the front of their new film. Elderly relatives aren&apos;t thrilled with this deal, as a strange film crew now uses their estate and possessions. With this sequel they manage to make another entertaining film with the familiar faces of the series and first film. The film splits into two different stories, which are somewhat intertwined. In one story, the young and old family members clash over how their estate is being used by an outside film crew. This makes for entertaining moments where the ideas of young and old collide. The other story is about the family members who inspect Violet Crawley&apos;s inherited mansion and learn new things about her past here. Both storylines are fun and interesting for fans of the Downton Abbey series and previous film. For film buffs it is also fascinating to see how films were made in the 1920s and how this changed during these times thanks to better techniques. The storytelling can take some getting used to for people who are not that familiar with the Downton Abbey series or film, because the story often jumps back and forth between the many different characters. This can make it feel a bit messy at times. Fortunately, screenwriter Julian Fellowes manages to keep it clear with the way in which everything comes together in the end. Connoisseurs of the TV series or movie connoisseurs in general can roughly predict what will happen and why some characters do what they are doing. The film sets, costumes, make-up and hairstyles also come across as appropriate for the time and place in which the film is set. Most of the well-known cast members of the series and first film are all in this film again and play their roles in their familiar way again. For variety, some do get the chance to create new situations in the beginning of this film together with cast members who play the French characters or characters from the film crew.",

            "reviewBody": "Aside from a few very marketable films like &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot;, Guy Ritchie is a writer/director who makes incredibly violent films. That is, incredibly violent films which are also brilliantly constructed and near perfect. While I rarely ever watch violent films, I eagerly look for his next dark British crime film, after seeing his &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; and &quot;Snatch&quot;....and so it&apos;s not surprising I&apos;d see &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;. And, like these other films, it&apos;s near perfect...and a film you ought to see if you have the stomach for this sort of story.\n\nSo this leads me to a huge warning. This is NOT a family-friendly film nor one you want to show your mother or Father Jenkins if he stops by for a visit. There&apos;s ample cursing, loads of violence, vomit galore, and the story is about bad people...very bad people.\n\nThe story is complicated...and goes together like a finely crafted puzzle. It concerns a marijuana czar in Britain, Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and his desire to sell out and retire to a life of ease and sophistication. However, after making an offer to a rival drug kingpin, suddenly everything goes haywire....folks start dying, farms growing the stuff are hit and an all-out war seems inevitable. There&apos;s WAY more to the story than this...but since it&apos;s so complex, it&apos;s best you just see it to appreciate it.\n\nThe bottom line is that Guy Ritchie can write and direct amazing films...and this one is truly amazing and entertaining. Apart from his misguided vanity project, &quot;Swept Away&quot;, his output has been impressive and I cannot stress enough what a quality product this film is. My only MINOR quibble is what about the Russian mobster.....what happens with him? This isn&apos;t really dealt with in the film and seems a bit like a dangling plot point.",

Do you remember the Disney&apos;s the Sword in the Stone? even the guy name is Arthur! Did you spotted the dinosaurs at Jurasic Park? I only missed a Smeagol-like scene with the trident... my prrrrecioussss.\n\nAh, and a very funny scene is watching Aquaman trying not to fall (and looking very scared) from the roof of one house in Sicily (two stories high) , when he&apos;d just jumped from a plane thousand meters high with no parachute in the desert.\n\nBut Nicole Kidman was beautiful as always.",

            "reviewBody": "&quot;Hindi viewers, please don&apos;t regret later on when it&apos;ll be playing on TV and internet.&quot; This is what I mentioned in my review of KGF Chapter 1 after I watched it in cinemas. And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash&apos;s screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.\n\nKGF Chapter 2 expands the scale and story introduced to us in part 1 and ends up raising the bar higher. The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. From beautifully picturizing the KGF (Kolar Gold Fields) to explosively choreographing the action sequences to elevating Rocky&apos;s character at multiple occasions, they have shown they knew what the viewers wanted, and delivered the promise product without any hassle. I was also glad to see heavy cheering and whistling throughout almost the entire duration, and some credit goes to the dialogue writer as well. The music was also good and delivered without interfering with the storytelling (though one song in the second half wasn&apos;t really necessary).\n\nThe biggest plus point of the film is its screenplay. From re-introducing our favorite characters and introducing new ones to building up conflicts and backing them with explosive action, KGF Chapter 2 has all the ingredients of a proper mass entertainer. Not a single scene where it feels dragged or overdone. Sure, it does feel long at times, but it never gets boring, and with several twists and turns, the story remains intriguing till the end.\n\nOne thing I&apos;d definitely want to tell the viewers is to not simply get up and walk away once the credits start rolling. There is a mid-credits scene, and it&apos;s an important one. Other than that, this film should be on your watchlist if you like period action films. In the end, I just feel glad and kind of proud seeing a film I liked in 2018 going on to receive much bigger hype and viewer turnout with its second part in 2022.",

The answer is simple:Captain Jack.From the moment he makes his entrance,justly included in the Empire Top 10 Entrances of all time,we know he&apos;s the reason people will keep watching the movie.He &apos;s Depp&apos;s best non-Tim Burton-character ever,and I can&apos;t wait &apos;til he returns.\n\nSee you next summer,Captain!",

            "reviewBody": "This review has been declined 3 times now. I don&apos;t know why, I think it&apos;s cos of the real name of Gilgamesh coinciding with an english word.\n\nThe whole film was pretty flat, John Snow turned up and said some funny lines, and Gemma Chan was lovely to look at, but there sure was a lot of cheese in this vegan meal of a film. Some terrible &apos;inspirational&apos; life messages delivered direct to camera that made you cringe with their rhetoric.\n\nIt played like it was constructed from a &quot;making big budget films for dummies&quot; book, and they left it at pretty much the bullet points list on the inside cover.\n\nShoehorn in a Diversity cast that differed greatly from the source material. I do like to see diversity on screen but sometimes it appears over zealous, like this film and comes across as forced and token and works against the world of the film. The Eternals are not from earth at all so no need to tick all the diversity check boxes. Quite the opposite, they should appear with no cultural links at all. They also shoe horned in a sign language eternal, which just made no sense in the world of the Eternals, Why would the massively powerful universe creators create an eternal who couldn&apos;t hear or speak and needed to use their hands to communicate? The original comics had Makkari as a Male who has a relationship with Sersi, in fact many of the original Eternals are male. I&apos;m all for positive representations on a diverse society, but this casting choice just came across as weird as far as the film&apos;s story was concerned.\n\nSlot in an ex boy band debut as an actor - Check!\n\nMy eyes rolled back into my head when that happened. Big budget movie making by the numbers.\n\nI don&apos;t know quite where the problem was. Chloé Zhao&apos;s direction by committee choices? It wasn&apos;t all bad, there was some decent acting, particularly Barry Keoghan who&apos;s character seemed complex, but,... even so it was roped in and never went anywhere. Gilgamesh also was good, until he was dispatched easily.\n\nThen they started fighting each other, and they&apos;re Eternals and can&apos;t die, except when it&apos;s convenient to move the plot along. It got boring really quickly.",

With mere weeks before impact and the world on the brink of annihilation, NASA executive and former astronaut Jo Fowler (Academy Award® winner Halle Berry) is convinced she has the key to saving us all - but only one astronaut from her past, Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson, &quot;Midway&quot;) and a conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman (John Bradley, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;) believes her. These unlikely heroes will mount an impossible last-ditch mission into space, leaving behind everyone they love, only to find out that our Moon is not what we think it is."

There were some details that were memorable, but I really didn&apos;t get invested in where it was going. I will agree that the lead actress did an amazing job, and most everyone else brought a realism to their roles, especially since they work in the adult film industry in real life. But I didn&apos;t feel like there was much connection between the scenes. Yes, the overall goal of the main character remains consistent, but I didn&apos;t feel like we were shown what motivated her to make the specific choices she did much of the time. The effect is that the story doesn&apos;t really progress and build believably. Even though it has an outstanding central performance, I felt this was a fairly average drama overall which happened to have a few scenes that were difficult to watch.",

            "reviewBody": "This is a very odd film, which feels far too melodramatic and miserable to be a James Bond story. It&apos;s more reminiscent of a serialised romantic drama or tragedy than that of a spy thriller. There are contradicting styles in the script that leaves the viewer totally confused as to why certain events or decisions are made and no real depth to any of characters that make the story plausible or, well, worth emotionally investing in.\n\nIf you think back to one of the classic Bond films you&apos;ll remember a much more optimistic, simple and pleasurable experience. Every story was unique and the next adventure was a whole new mission. This suave and somewhat-blithe secret agent was solely invested in protecting national security and saving the world from unhinged megalomaniacs. Along the way there were interesting characters, exotic locations, beautiful women, stylish outfits, new gadgets and the most modern of cars (also fitted with the gadgets).\n\nThe five Craig-era films have spent 15 years moping about the same event which happened back in the first, without really moving on. His Bond seems more like a &apos;prima donna&apos; that leaves, sulks and refuses to help more times than a French trade union. I refuse to believe than anyone with his psychological and unstable emotional profile would ever be drafted in as a 00 Agent. What is also forgotten is than Bond is a secret agent, not a frontline commando - aka John Rambo. He should be stealth, intelligence and subterfuge, with only action and violence where necessary.\n\nStill, having actually enjoyed Skyfall (which subsequently seems like the odd one out in series) and having waited years since the last (thank you Covid-19), I accepted an invite to a pre-screening.\n\nThe positives: \n* The &apos;alternative&apos; 007 was actually a good character. She was physically imposing enough to be believable as another 00 Agent and is a good actress. Nothing worse than being told that a size-0 model can boot a &apos;pro-wrestler&apos; sized henchman across the room and forced to accept it.\n\n\n\n* The filmography was impressive. Maybe the large screen helps amplify how good the camera-work quality really is. Some lovely shooting involved.\n\n\nThe negatives: \n* Rami Malek&apos;s character made no sense and was effectively &apos;cardboard&apos;. To have an Oscar-winning actor and effectively make him a dull two-dimensional side character is a total under use of talent.\n\n\n\n* The plot and script writing. One of the things that is known about this film is how the script was rewritten mid/post production, and it shows. It&apos;s all over the place. What appears evident is how the first cut must have felt too gloomy in editing, so the producers brought in Waller-Bridge to lighten it up. Unfortunately, adding in random comedy lines or moments does not take away how miserable this film is.\n\n\n\n* The odd logic and lack of people. The reshoots have clearly affected how scenes play out. For example, instead of controlling missions from a control centre (think Goldeneye), Ralph Fiennes (M) was just in his office with Rory Kinnear, seeming almost low budget. The final scene was just six people in an office with a drink - where on Earth is the rest of the intelligence service in this who film? Clearly &apos;social distancing&apos; themselves from this mess.\n\n\n\n* The romance. The chemistry between Bond and leading love interest is about as reactive as a nobel gas. Flat and painful. So, to have two films of the same thing is beyond the pale.\n\n\n\n* The music. I can&apos;t even remember the theme tune, so not even worth my time commenting on. Clearly it was so bad that Hans Zimmer instead decided to base the soundtrack using &apos;On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service&apos; all the way. Why plagiarise a film from the 60s and use arguably one of the worse films in the franchise? Clearly, Louis Armstrong was not available to decline.\n\n\n\n* Treatment of classic characters. It&apos;s clear that the producers want to draw a line under the franchise and start afresh - pandering to the &apos;woke mob&apos; and hoping that future tokenistic nonsense will prove as successful as the original premise was. Spoiler: It won&apos;t and never will.\n\n\nThe producers are clearly inept at creating anything that remotely feels as good or as likeable as it once was. This is an institution and it deserves respect, not total destruction. Classic Bond films will continue to be on TV and still fondly remembered for years to come. I don&apos;t think this film will ever want to be watched again. That is what speaks the loudest.",

Yeah, the villains are unidimensional and the background story is kind of generic, but this delivers what it promises, being an inoffensive fun film, reminding a lot of what we had in the past decades.\n\nPS: Great soundtrack!",

            "reviewBody": "Suspenseful and terrifying entertainment that goes beyond its genre , dealing with a girl who has the unwanted and often uncontrollable gift of Pyrokinesis, as a result of a government experiment , lighting fires by mere thought . A couple Victoria &apos;Vicky&apos; Tomlinson McGee (Heather Locklear of Dynasty) and Andy McGee (David Keith , he was 14th choice) who participated in a potent medical experiment gain telekinetic ability and then have a child named Charlene &apos;Charlie&apos; McGee (Jennifer Connelly , Taylor Neff were considered and Bridgette Andersen, the star of Savannah Smiles, tested for the role of Charlie, ultimately played by Drew Barrymore) who is pyrokinetic . Charlie McGee (whose character was modeled on King&apos;s daughter Naomi) has an extraordinary power (or is that haunted) , sometimes uncontrollable and an evil destructive force . Meanwhile a secret government agency known as &quot;The Shop&quot; led by Captain Hollister (Martin Sheen took over at a late stage from Burt Lancaster who had to withdraw following heart surgery) and send a sniper named John Rainbird (George C Scott) and plot to kidnap the duo for study them and testing their abilities.\n\nThis exciting tale packs noisy action , explosions , suspense , thriller , chills , poignant plot and results to be an enjoyable though frightening entertainment , including some silly and embarrassing scenes . The movie delivers the goods with hair-rising thrills as when the little girl executes the astonishing abilities . It stars Drew Barrymore in one of her first roles after E.T. , as the gifted child of the title who has the ability to ignite objects around her . David Keith is good as the daddy who attempts to protect her from the nasties . Secondary cast is frankly excellent as Freddie Jones as Doctor Joseph Wanley , Art Carney as Irv Manders , Louise Fletcher as Norma Manders , Moses Gunn as Doctor Pynchot and Antonio Fargas as a Cabman . The fire special effects , themselves , of course , are the real protagonists , and they&apos;re surprising , astounding, and quite convincing . The special effects gave work to a great number of technician people and lots of stunts . This film was originally going to be directed by John Carpenter. According to Carpenter, Universal executives removed him from the project in the wake of the box office and critical drubbing they received for The Thing ,Carpenter had reportedly talked to his Assault on Precinct 13 actor, Darwin Joston about taking on the role of John Rainbird, which was ultimately played by George C. Scott . Strange soundtrack by Tangerine Dream was composed and performed by means of synthesizer ,they never actually saw the film and sent filmmaker some music and told him to choose whatever he liked . It was followed by ¨Firestarter 2 : rekindled¨ (2002) by Robert Iscove with Marguerite Moreau as Charlene &quot;Charlie&quot; McGee , Malcolm McDowell , Dennis Hopper and Danny Nucci and in which Charlie has been in hiding for nearly all her life from a top-secret government fringe group headed by a maniacal who wants to find and use her as the ultimate weapon of war. \n\nThe motion picture was well produced by Dino Laurentiis and professionally directed by Mark L. Lester. Director Mark L. Lester confirmed that this is his most difficult film that he ever made . He&apos;s a cool director and producer -American World Pictures- of B movies , his greatest success was during the 80s when he directed hits , such as ¨Commando¨, ¨Showdown in Little Tokio¨ and ¨Class of 99¨ and this ¨Firestarter¨.",

            "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know how many times I can express my love for Liam Neeson - the words, &quot;I love Liam Neeson&quot; have probably left my mouth more often than the times I have expressed love toward my own parents. Nowadays, however, my self-proclaimed adoration toward the star feels less like genuine admiration and more like a desperate attempt to convince myself I am still a fan of his. Because, even after the simultaneous physical and mental pain I have endured while watching his recent films, including &quot;The Marksman,&quot; &quot;Blacklight,&quot; &quot;The Ice Road,&quot; and &quot;Honest Thief,&quot; I still find myself at the theatre opening weekend every time a new Neeson movie is released, knowing the movie will not be good, but hoping against hope that it might be. Spoiler alert: &quot;Memory&quot; isn&apos;t good.\n\nIt&apos;s astonishing to me that the caliber of filmmakers, actors, and actresses on display in &quot;Memory&quot; have turned over a product that seems more like a money-laundering scheme than a real film. Is this the same Martin Campbell that directed &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Goldeneye,&quot; two of the best action movies of all time? The same Martin Campbell that also recently made &quot;The Foreigner&quot; and &quot;The Protege,&quot; two movies that - while not perfect - still managed to be slick and stylish with a handful of excellent action sequences? Doesn&apos;t this movie star three of the best actors working today: Liam Neeson, Guy Pearce, and Monica Bellucci? With all this talent in front of and behind the camera, where did &quot;Memory&quot; go wrong?\n\nWith the intriguing premise of having Neeson play a hitman who is battling Alzheimer&apos;s just as much as he is battling flesh and blood humans, &quot;Memory&quot; commits a cardinal sin of doing absolutely nothing interesting with this unique concept. You&apos;d think such a plot would be ripe for opportunity, and it is. Campbell and crew instead just decide to do nothing with it. A film portraying an assassin with memory loss is reduced to the most generic depictions of the affliction - Liam fails to recall where he left his car keys; Liam wakes up not remembering where he is, and then questions someone, asking them if he was in a specific place all night; Liam draws a blank on where he left a specific item. A crippling, dehumanizing disease such as Alzheimer&apos;s is reduced to bargain-bin generalities that are as predictable as they are boring; even an ounce of creativity would&apos;ve been appreciated.\n\nBecause of this shocking lack of innovation, the story &quot;Memory&quot; decides to tell just isn&apos;t that interesting. IMDb describes the plot as: &quot;An assassin-for-hire finds that he&apos;s become a target after he refuses to complete a job for a dangerous criminal organization.&quot; Sure, it&apos;s something we&apos;ve seen done before, but I&apos;ll give &quot;Memory&quot; credit where credit is due, as there are a few twists along the way that I didn&apos;t expect. However, the hook of having the main character be someone who suffers from memory loss is practically tossed out the window to instead make room for storytelling that is on par with direct-to-DVD geezer-teasers. If you love watching scene after scene of people sitting in rooms having horrendously boring conversations about catching criminals, and not watching said people actually take action toward catching said criminals, then you&apos;re going to love this movie because it has been tailor made for you. With only a spattering of action sequences, &quot;Memory&quot; devolves into a talkie that is only somewhat well-acted, and somewhat well-written. Liam and Guy bring their A-game, as always - you&apos;d be hard pressed to find either of them give a noticeably bad performance. Everyone else? Borderline embarrassing. Wooden dialogue, stilted acting, and just flat-out bad performances plague this movie; at almost every turn I found myself cringing in my seat, my body heat rising from the second hand embarrassment. Not convinced? I&apos;ll give you ten dollars if you see this movie and don&apos;t have a seizure from how hilariously awful the pigeon poop line is.\n\nBut alas, if you&apos;re going to see &quot;Memory,&quot; you are certainly a fan of Liam Neeson action films, and want to go watch him do what he does best. Does this movie deliver in terms of action? Somewhat. The opening action scene is cool, but it&apos;s not really action-heavy or even that visually interesting - it just kind of happens while being neither uninteresting or entertaining. And this theme continues throughout virtually every depiction of violence in this movie. Sure, it&apos;s always cool to watch a hitman kill people, but I&apos;d also like to see some creativity at play, some tension being built, some suspense bubbling beneath the surface; you don&apos;t get that here. Action comes and then quickly goes almost as fast as it arrived, with little fanfare, almost as if the filmmakers found it tedious to shoot. There is one genuinely entertaining action sequence that takes place in a parking garage that includes fists being thrown and guns being fired - that said, I noticed that, in addition to it looking bland from a visual perspective, the editing was jarring in a few places, cutting suddenly from angle to angle without narrative cohesion.\n\nAnd speaking of how this movie looks, I&apos;d be remiss if I didn&apos;t mention the visual flair that &quot;Memory&quot; employs, or in this case, the lack thereof. This film looks incredibly dull, with no flair or style to speak of; if you would&apos;ve told me this was filmed to be sent directly to streaming, I&apos;d believe you. This was the most shocking aspect of the movie to me, as Martin Campbell typically delivers a stylish picture. However, whether from disinterest or a lack of adequate quality control, &quot;Memory&quot; is about as interesting visually as a newspaper that you&apos;ve already read: You know what you&apos;re getting into when you sit down to look at it - there are no surprises.\n\nComplaints aside, I didn&apos;t hate this movie. The little action it did have captivated my attention when it was on screen, and it&apos;s always fun to see Liam being Liam on the big screen. Slight twists and turns had me genuinely shocked, holding my engagement just enough for me to actively see how the story ended. All of that said, at its core, &quot;Memory&quot; is a boring, poorly made film. Virtually every aspect, from the visuals to the storytelling, is generic to the extreme, with little to no genre innovation. The unique premise is not utilized at all, and the action is so sparse that you&apos;ll most likely forget you&apos;re watching an action film. If you happen to see this movie on streaming one night, I imagine you won&apos;t feel like you&apos;ve wasted time, but I can say with certainty that &quot;Memory&quot; is not a film you need to see at the cinema.",

She finds herself torn between pursuing her love of music and her family&apos;s reliance on her to be their connection to the outside world. I would like to say how much of a crowd pleaser this is. All of the reviews have come back positive saying this is the best opener since Whiplash. The performances are good all around. What got to me most is the family dynamic. It&apos;s something really heart-warming to watch that put a smile on my face the whole time. The comedy landed well throughout. The same goes for the drama. Sian Heder is a good director and we see the heart put into the movie. The story is where some of my issues came from. It follows a typical storyline that we&apos;ve seen before in movies geared toward teens. It became predictable along the way and some of the scenes felt too good to be true. But I understand this isn&apos;t meant to be something to breakdown and analyze. All in all, this is meant to make us feel good and that&apos;s exactly what it did. I look forward to rewatching this again in the future.",

I don&apos;t know.\n\nMaybe because Gunn was clearly let off the leash he didn&apos;t have to restrain himself and so moments that may have been handled with more care were allowed to simply explode?\n\nThere is a lot of blood and gore, which is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nAs I said, I enjoyed it, and I will watch it again someday, I&apos;m just in no big rush to revisit it.\n\nA generous seven out of ten.\n\nI&apos;ve read the Suicide Squad and DC comics for a very long time, and all the low reviews with the &apos;restore the Snyderverse&apos; hashtag can go away.",

            "reviewBody": "Kingsman: The Secret Service was one of the biggest surprises in a cinema I&apos;ve had in the last decade. I remember being excited for it but I never expected to fall in love with it as much as I did and the film still holds up every time I rewatch it. I even enjoyed The Golden Circle, it&apos;s not perfect and nowhere near as good as the original but I still get a lot of enjoyment out of it. But from the moment The King&apos;s Man was announced I just couldn&apos;t understand why it was being made. I don&apos;t dislike the idea of doing a prequel film but I thought the franchise would be better suited to finishing up the Harry/Eggsy story first before going into spin off and prequel territory. I was hoping this film would surprise me by being a different kind of entry for the franchise but unfortunately it was every bit as pointless as I feared it would be.\n\nI think the thing that stops this film from being bad overall is it&apos;s central characters. Ralph Fiennes is great in this film, he is as perfectly cast in this role as Colin Firth was in the 2015 original. He brings all the charm and etiquette you&apos;d expect from this type of character while being completely capable in all the action scenes. I also really liked newcomer Harris Dickinson, he gives a really good performance and has great chemistry with Fiennes. I liked that Vaughn didn&apos;t just make him an Eggsy clone, he&apos;s a very different character and much more stern and serious and it works surprisingly well. Djimon Hounsou and Gemma Arterton made for really likeable and entertaining side kicks and they actually ended up stealing the movie for large portions. Most of the villains I found to be underwhelming but with the exception of Rhys Ifan who may have ultimately been the best part of the entire experience for me. He was delightfully over the top, capable and threatening in all the fight scenes and hilariously funny, it&apos;s only a shame that he wasn&apos;t in the film more.\n\nI think The King&apos;s Man best finds it&apos;s footing in it&apos;s 3rd act. It&apos;s when all of the masses exposition start to pay off in some way and it&apos;s in this part of the film that it truly starts to feel like a proper Kingsman prequel. I started to recognise the tropes I love in those other two films and I have to praise that this did make the film end on a reasonably solid note for me. However a fairly good ending doesn&apos;t make up for the nearly 2 hour slog that The King&apos;s Man is leading up to that 3rd act. Vaughn spends most of the film trying to compress years of history into a 2 hour runtime and it feels unbelievably messy as a result. While I liked most of the action sequences they are few and far between and I have to say that I found the film boring for the most part. I think Vaughn was a little bit too devoted to real life events and I think he may have benefitted from taking some more creative liberties that better suited the Kingsman universe.\n\nIn addition to how poorly paced the film was I also have no idea what Vaughn&apos;s ultimate vision for it was. The tone shifts between being a serious war drama and a more over the top spy film constantly, sometimes in the same scene, and these two styles do not mix well. The film spends large portions devoted to the trenches of World War One just to abruptly switch to the goofy, moustache twirling villains plotting their evil plans to take over the world and it just makes those more serious moments feel cheap by comparison. It&apos;s hard to feel like I&apos;m watching a Kingsman film when I&apos;m watching the battle sequences and it&apos;s hard to feel like I&apos;m watching a war movie in those more Kingsman oriented scenes.\n\nI think there is a potentially good prequel somewhere inside this movie but it&apos;s buried underneath messy storytelling and two polar opposite tones that make me confused as too what kind of film I&apos;m supposed to be watching. Thankfully it&apos;s central characters lift the film up somewhat and it&apos;s not without its entertaining and effective scenes but I just don&apos;t think Vaughn had a clear idea for what he wanted to do with this prequel. I think the best thing the franchise could do now is finish up the Harry/Eggsy trilogy and end things on as strong a note as possible.\n\n6.2/10 - C+ (Middling)",

            "reviewBody": "Overly ambitious project about a millennial love arc that ends in heartbreak, but what are the lessons learned? Murphy (Karl Glusman) is an open-minded film student in Paris who meets Elektra (Aomi Muyock), and the two embrace their high sex drives with giddyness. However, after the relationship embraces polyamory and swingers culture, only one of the two is emotionally stable enough to handle it.\n\nThe film is directed really well by Noé, who by now should know well enough how to make it all super claustrophobic and uncomfortable for the viewer. The cinematography is good but relies too heavily on saturation but it&apos;s never really an issue. Nonlinear storytelling is clear, concise, and there&apos;s some really neat editing at parts. The story does drag often, and the film overall could&apos;ve cut out 10-15 minutes of filler.\n\nThe real issue with &quot;Love&quot; is the lack of chemistry between Murphy and Elektra -- we just don&apos;t see it, pretty much ever. The writing is there, but the actors just cannot grasp it. This is largely because -- are you ready? -- they aren&apos;t actors; Noé met both Glusman and Muyock in a club one night and asked them to star. It&apos;s clear that he wanted to achieve the most organic and natural relationship dynamic on-screen by not using &quot;real actors&quot; -- but in what is supposed to be an emotionally charged film, that just doesn&apos;t work.\n\nIn fact, in a sort of disturbingly surreal manner, the very same issues that the film is trying to highlight in millennial relationships (emotional maturity and boundaries over sex) seem to show up in the unsimulated sex scenes between Glusman and Muyock. Glusman constantly falls out of character, allowing his own sexual desire to ruin the scene and any emotional impact Noé was looking for. Muyock seems bored and uninterested -- and who could blame her? -- likely due to Glusman&apos;s obvious zeal about getting paid to fuck her. I&apos;m not sure he entirely understood the fact he was in an art film, and in remaining ignorant, he ends up verifying Noé&apos;s entire thesis: young adults, especially men, get lost in the idea of sexual nirvana over the thing that truly matters: love.\n\nThe second half of the film lifts the veil on Murphy&apos;s narcissistic and emotionally abusive behavior in the relationship, and tragically, Glusman is a good actor when portraying an unstable douchebag (and Muyock is phenomenal when screaming at him).\n\nThe film finishes the same place it starts, seeming to depict Murphy at rock-bottom in a horrible and accidental family dynamic: a fitting bookend to a relationship that was destroyed not by too much sex, but his own fear of it. The ending is eerie and powerful, and hints at the generational ripples that will be felt for decades because of his own actions. It&apos;s a great story, and sort of well-acted, but it ends up merely tripping up on its own interpretation of reality instead of offering us anything particularly new.",

To be honest, the inclusion of a little song and dance in such a harsh subject movie is a bit new to me but it was still a very good movie to see even subtitled. For those that have not seen any Indian movies, go see this one. It&apos;s well done. You may want to sit up a little closer to read the subtitles easier. I will be keeping my eye out for other movies from India.",

            "reviewBody": "A friend of mine told me that I had to sit down to watch the 2022 action thriller &quot;The Contractor&quot; as it was a really good movie. So I took his word and opted to sit down and watch what writer J. P. Davis and director Tarik Saleh had to offer with &quot;The Contractor&quot;.\n\nAnd I will say that &quot;The Contractor&quot; was definitely watchable, but it wasn&apos;t an outstanding action thriller. Whereas it certainly was entertaining, I just found the storyline to be somewhat bland and generic. And writer J. P. Davis just didn&apos;t bring much of anything new to the genre. A shame really, because there certainly was pontential for a lot more here.\n\nThe storyline, while somewhat generic, was interesting enough and made for good entertainment. So yeah, I will say that &quot;The Contractor&quot; is worth taking the time to sit down and watch. Just keep in mind that you are not in for a revolutionary action thriller here. The pacing of the storyline was good, and there was a good combination of character development and action throughout the course of the movie.\n\nWas &quot;The Contractor&quot; predictable? You betcha. But it was not really a hindrance for the plot, because the movie ended up being rather enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nThe movie had a good cast ensemble, and it was nice to see Chris Pine in a movie such as this one. Ben Foster was also rather nicely cast for the movie, and it was definitely a treat to see Keifer Sutherland in the movie, and he had a rather good role in &quot;The Contractor&quot;.\n\nAll in all, then &quot;The Contractor&quot; makes good entertainment for a single viewing. And I do say single viewing, because there simply wasn&apos;t enough contents to the storyline to support more than a single viewing here. So yeah, I am not going to be returning to watch &quot;The Contractor&quot; a second time.\n\nMy rating of director Tarik Saleh&apos;s 2022 action thriller &quot;The Contractor&quot; lands on a six out of ten stars.",

We&apos;ve seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.\n\nEverything that&apos;s been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.\n\nFor as much action as there is in this movie, it&apos;s the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.\n\nBale&apos;s Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox&apos;s inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. \n\nAs for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It&apos;s not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker&apos;s stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could&apos;ve pulled something like this off. That&apos;s how difficult of a role this was, and that&apos;s why Ledger&apos;s performance is so great.\n\nThis isn&apos;t an action movie. It&apos;s a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it&apos;s all in there.",

            "reviewBody": "Finally a Pirates of the Caribbean movie that I felt quite at par with the original one. I felt in this movie, the elements of entertainment were quite abundant. Unlike in the 4th installment, I think this one is funnier, more thrilling and gave the sense of happiness at the end. This time,, the movie was not solely telling the story of Jack Sparrow. Instead the other characters, especially Henry and Carina were given quite a lot screen time. It was nice to see Jack Sparrow&apos;s charm and wit plus his insistence of helping other people.\n\nThis movie provided some background story of Jack while he was young, which was very interesting to see. The movie was filled with lots of fun and laughter but also few brief touching moments. The story was good and there were some surprises too. As a high budget movie, the movie was filled with very good special effects (some done by the Industrial Light Magic). I totally loved the effects of the deads (Salazar&apos;s crews), his ship and of course the very cool special effects at the end.\n\nI also felt that the movie did not have any dull moment. From beginning till the end, there were always something interesting to see. My wife and I were entertained throughout the whole movie which was having a duration of a little over 2 hours. Amazingly, due to the sense of excitement, my wife was able to hold going to the bathroom till finished. I guess she forgotten about it while watching.\n\nActually, even though I looked forward to see this movie, I was a bit skeptical at first about whether this one would be good enough. I felt that the 4th one was a little bit dull, and also a bit forced. The story for that one did not feel strong enough and certainly did not give a lot of impression. But this one really felt it was worthy of giving another sequel after this. Especially if you wait till the very end, after the end-credit scene, where we were given something interesting to ponder. Might be the potential story for the sequel? Perhaps if this one is successful enough.\n\nI believe this one really worth to see. I am happy to see Johnny Depp in this movie which I hope would be a commercial success for him. Since his past few movies were unfortunately not really successful ones. Maybe people grew tired of his acting as unusual characters. So if you are looking for something fun, light, interesting movie with funny charming pirate and treasure hunt story, you should definitely watch this one. I am confident you would be entertained like my wife and I were.\n\nFor my complete review, pls have a look in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",

The climax of the film is fantastic though, and it does make it feel like it was all worth it for the most part. There isn&apos;t really a defined narrative, which may put some people off but Tarantino&apos;s sublime dialogue and the great performances make all of the scenes at least entertaining. It&apos;s no Pulp Fiction, but it definitely is one of the most original films I&apos;ve seen in a while.",

But at a certain point, where what I&apos;d call the &quot;second act&quot; begins, I looked to see how much was left of the movie, thinking it was about the time in a noir when things really get going like a runaway freight train, and realized it was only half over!\n\nI felt pretty restless at that point, in spite of Cate Blanchett&apos;s pitch-perfect performance. It wasn&apos;t so much that less time should have been used up in the first act as that every single thing should have been shorter. This should have had the brisk quality of classic noir, instead of the slow boil noir here.\n\nThe movie does finally go into runaway freight train mode almost two hours in, and that last part is intense and gripping and everything you&apos;d want it to be, but really this whole movie should have been 90-100 minutes and a good finale doesn&apos;t erase the boredom I&apos;d felt for most of the previous hour.\n\nDel Toro&apos;s a terrific director, the movie looks amazing, and Blanchett is phenomenal, so I won&apos;t say skip it. I will say, lower your expectations and don&apos;t count on something worthy of the best picture Oscar nomination this got.",

            "reviewBody": "One glance at FREE GUY, the newest big budget offering from Hollywood&apos;s favorite action-star/comedy master Ryan Reynolds, will cause most to approach with valid skepticism. The plot seems like a cheap knockoff of films like Ready Player One or even The Matrix, but made in a crude fashion to make more money at the box office. The actual movie, however, could not be further from the worst estimates. Not only is FREE GUY constantly hilarious due to Reynolds and an inventive screenplay, and not only is this possibly the feel-good event of the summer, but it also has a considerable amount of thought put into the meaning of its premise and places a mirror in front of modern-day video game culture.\n\nTo put it simply, perhaps the main reason this movie comes together so well is because of Ryan Reynolds&apos; constant charisma and hilarity. Most of his dialogue is clearly either written by him or created by him on the spot (I have no idea how he hasn&apos;t received a screenwriting credit for this and the Deadpool movies), and the film is that much better as a whole because of it. He also interacts with the other actors in the film very well, including Jodie Comer and Joe Keery, two underrated actors who prove here that they aren&apos;t just one-time stars from their respective television shows (Killing Eve and Stranger Things). The ensemble combines to create the most consistently funny movie of 2021 so far.\n\nHowever, this movie isn&apos;t just hilarity and crazy antics, although it could easily get by on those aspects alone. FREE GUY has tons of heart and authenticity despite its virtual reality-based plot, and is about very human emotions such as disillusionment, the feeling of being trapped, and, of course, love. There are times where the heartwarming aspects of this film resemble a charming romantic comedy and others where it gets so existential that it almost feels like The Truman Show. It never dives quite as deep as the latter film, but the fact that it even has the guts to include these themes made this easygoing big-budget movie a far better watch for me. Sure, the last thirty minutes are very cheesy and contain a lot of clichés, but the buildup is so solid that it earns some dumb rom-com moments near the end.\n\nFREE GUY is worth going to see because it is one of the few quality films right now that increases one&apos;s faith in human nature. Lately I feel as though I have lost my faith in humanity with all that is happening in the world, so it is refreshing to get a movie that feels confident in the human experience. Maybe I&apos;m looking too deep into the message of FREE GUY and maybe it was conceived just so Ryan Reynolds could screw around for two hours, but either way the price of admission is well worth it for an amazing time at the theater.\n\nA-",

A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks.

It&apos;s utterly disturbing too with some of the things it does. Just when you think it can&apos;t get anymore disturbing it ups that completely. It&apos;s fast paced, as soon as everything hits it just gets outrageous and it is brilliant. With it being full pedal to the metal and being incredibly stressful and tense. There&apos;s a moment it slows down and it&apos;s good to have this moment so you can have a breather before we get pulled back in and punched straight in the face with the extreme scenes and buckets of blood. The Sadness does have many horrific scenes and it&apos;s some of the most shocking stuff I&apos;ve seen in some time. It is though one of the most brilliant Horrors I&apos;ve seen recently, it&apos;s so well made, never holds back with how far it will go and keeps you on the edge throughout.

We are given a hauting roller-coaster ride through a comedy of terrors that is the mind of this being who seems human but isn&apos;t quite sure himself. In fact, he doesn&apos;t even know who or what he is.\n\nIs he insane? Are we? That&apos;s the joker in the gamble.

            "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t have a ton of expectations going into this movie but I thoroughly enjoyed The Shining (like much of the human population) so I was expecting a good continuation of the original story line. Overall I think Mike Flanagan was able to deliver. The way the movie was filmed and edited really exemplified a typical horror movie. Doctor sleep includes a constant mist in the settings, there are a lot of dramatic slow panoramic shots, and the music is eerie and impactful. The acting is pretty decent but in my opinion Rebecca Ferguson absolutely shined as Rose the Hat. Ferguson put in so much emotion into her character and her expressions throughout the movie were just so unsettling, it was pure perfection. I didn&apos;t find Doctor Sleep to be very scary I might classify it as more thriller, there were a few jump scares and a few shots disgusted me but nothing really shook me to my core, which is fine. Overall as an avid fan of horror movies and King I enjoyed this movie a lot and might even say it&apos;s one of the best horror movies of the year.",

            "reviewBody": "At least &apos;Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021)&apos; is brief. That&apos;s pretty much the only praise I can send its way. I mean, it&apos;s genuinely terrible. Frankly, it&apos;s almost unfathomable how a team as talented as this can turn out something so amateurish. It honestly feels unfinished. Having said that, it&apos;s actually difficult to properly review, because it&apos;s just... well, nothing. It&apos;s not even boring. It&apos;s totally empty, a meal comprised of zero calories. It&apos;s also insanely forgettable. If you asked me to recount its plot beat for beat, even while the credits were still rolling, I&apos;d seriously struggle to come up with a coherent answer. As I said, it&apos;s difficult to properly review. Perhaps that&apos;s because reflecting on it is like trying to remember a bad dream; by the time you try to articulate it, it has already slipped from your mind. Perhaps it&apos;s because it leaves you feeling totally apathetic, unequipped to even think about its events, never mind its shortcomings. Perhaps it&apos;s because the flick is genuinely less boring than many movies deserving of a similar, or even marginally better, rating, but also genuinely worse than most of those same movies. A bad movie is better than a boring one, I suppose, but a movie that leaves you feeling nothing, not even annoyance, is surely the bottom of the barrel. It goes in one ear and straight out of the other. It&apos;s awful, but I can&apos;t bring myself to get worked up about it. I&apos;m aware that I haven&apos;t even begun to delve into its cavalcade of issues, but I just can&apos;t bring myself to do so. That in itself says a lot. I&apos;m totally ambivalent about the piece. It isn&apos;t fun, but it isn&apos;t boring; it isn&apos;t competent, but it isn&apos;t offensive; it isn&apos;t anything, but it isn&apos;t... well, anything. In the end, it will leave you feeling like Venom himself: hungry for something with a brain. Heck, even a bar of chocolate would be more fulfilling. 3/10.",

When an injury ends his amateur boxing career, Stuart Long moves to L.A. dreaming of stardom. While scraping by as a supermarket clerk, he meets Carmen, a Catholic Sunday school teacher who seems immune to his bad-boy charm. Determined to win her over, the longtime agnostic starts going to church to impress her. But surviving a terrible motorcycle accident leaves him wondering if he can use his second chance to help others find their way, leading to the surprising realization that he is meant to be a Catholic priest. Despite a devastating health crisis and the skepticism of Church officials and his estranged parents, Stu pursues his vocation with courage and compassion, inspiring not only those closest to him but countless others along the way."

            "reviewBody": "The Witch (2015) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nExtremely well-made horror film set in New England during the 1600s as a family moves away from a colony and starts a new life in a house on the edge of some woods. One day the oldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) is watching her baby brother when something from the woods takes the child. Soon the family is torn apart by witchcraft.\n\nWriter-director Robert Eggers&apos; THE WITCH is the latest horror movie that is getting raves from critics and fans and it&apos;s also the newest movie to be called the &quot;scariest of all time.&quot; I&apos;m not going to sit here and say the movie scared me because it really didn&apos;t. With that said, THE WITCH really was a refreshing throwback to various European horror films from the late 60s and early 70s where atmosphere was the most important thing.\n\nI really respected that Eggers tried to deliver a religious horror film that didn&apos;t deal with cheap shock effects and needless over-the-top exorcisms. There&apos;s really not any graphic violence or gore either. Instead of going for these cheap jump scares the director instead builds up a terrific setting and slowly plays out the action. The film clocks in at just over 90 minutes and rest assure that every single second is well-made, effective and it slowly builds up to its conclusion. I&apos;m sure mainstream teenage viewers won&apos;t enjoy such a slow build-up but adults should enjoy this.\n\nThe atmosphere is certainly the selling point of the movie. I thought the director made you believe that you were watching something taking place in the 1600s and there&apos;s no question that the entire cast does a very good job in their parts. The atmosphere is certainly rich and thick and manages to set the film apart from most of the horror movies out there now. As I said, I wasn&apos;t scared by THE WITCH but it did a good job at slowly building up the drama and it plays out extremely well."

            "reviewBody": "This film&apos;s trailer and classification might lead you to believe it&apos;s a comedy and although it has some humor in it, it is primary a drama. I was expecting lots of laughs based on the trailer, but I realized the editing on the trailer doesn&apos;t match the type of editing style of the actual film.\n\nThe film is about two post-war veteran army rangers. Both have unresolved issues. One of the veterans is Army Ranger, Jackson Briggs (Channing Tatum). The second is a K-9 Army Ranger by the name of Lulu.\n\nAfter Lulu&apos;s master death, Briggs is charged with the task of delivering the K-9 to its former master&apos;s funeral for a last goodbye. The two rangers are reluctantly paired together on a long road trip to the funeral. While on their journey there, the two eventually find comfort and solace in each other. But there are plenty of hiccups along the way.\n\nThe film doesn&apos;t spell out what Briggs and Lulu are going through. The story is carefully explained through the nuances in their acting and body language. So, this is a read between the lines type of movie. The film is a bit slow but that&apos;s probably a good thing considering what the intent of the film is meant to be. Briggs also has domestic issues, but the true nature of the issues aren&apos;t disclosed. But based on the fact he wants to leave on another rotation to active duty, it seems he is trying to escape problems with his daughter&apos;s mother. Can&apos;t tell if he is married to her or just a girlfriend.\n\nIt&apos;s a good film but probably not a film children will enjoy but empathic adults will understand. Particularly military families.",

            "reviewBody": "The second Ridley Scott film of this year is here! After his medieval epic The Last Duel flopped brilliantly at the box office, he can expect more in this respect with House of Gucci. Not only is Gucci one of the most famous and prestigious fashion brands, Lady Gaga is also in the lead role. I guess the strong fanbase of the singer will not be asked a second time. In the film, she suddenly finds herself part of the Gucci dynasty and becomes the protagonist of a toxic power struggle.\n\nYet Gaga is still a relative unknown in Hollywood-speak. She made her big breakthrough in the 2018 music film A Star is Born. Scott, as he did in The Last Duel, has assembled an incomparable star ensemble. Adam Driver, who seems to be establishing himself as the director&apos;s new darling, evergreens Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons and an unrecognisable Jared Leto embody the key roles in the Gucci clan. In addition, Salma Hayek emerges as a kind of mentor for Gaga&apos;s character. But who is Gaga playing anyway? She is the young and rebellious Patrizia Reggiani. An extroverted perennial who worms her way into the millionaire family with charm and fascination. She is courted by the ambitious Maurizio Gucci, played by Driver, who actually wants to leave the intrigues and sometimes shabby business dealings of his predecessors behind. Once he falls in love with Patrizia and marries her, he is left with no choice but to get involved again. Driver and Gaga share a very passionate chemistry in the first act, which you fully buy into with little dialogue and through pure body language. While Driver plays rather reserved and shy, this quality emanates especially from Gaga, who doesn&apos;t hold back in any of her intimate scenes. At least the two characters are able to unfold their own approaches here. But when Al Pacino&apos;s character Aldo Gucci, Maurizio&apos;s uncle, insists on his nephew&apos;s re-entry into the family business, the two lose all closeness to each other. Rather, it is only an extremely manipulative relationship that both actors have to show in a few scenes. All the more Aldo and his son Paolo Gucci, portrayed by Leto, come to the fore. From this point on, the film lapses into a few minutes of megalomania, largely due to Leto&apos;s performance. He is exclusively eccentric and desperate and all in all a tragic figure. Whether you find this Super Mario caricature brilliant or miserable is a matter of interpretation.\n\nHouse of Gucci begins extremely quietly and shows the rise of the lovers in well-done visual sequences. The performances are generally fitting and although the film seems anti-Italian, I love it when Adam Driver cruises through Milan on his Vespa. But as interesting as the pecking order and hierarchy within the Gucci family is, from the second act onwards the film devolves into an overplayed and hyperactive tragedy that, despite the craziness of its scenes and actors, actually manages to be long-winded. Fashion, creativity and the business idea are not a theme at all, which in no way brings us closer to this brand that is so present. In the end we have a family epic (the film lasts 2 ½ hours), with exclusively unsympathetic characters. One more request to Ridley Scott: just let your actors speak English and don&apos;t embarrass them with Italian stereotypes with accents.",

            "reviewBody": "Finally got round to seeing &apos;The Danish Girl&apos; last night, having been intrigued by it (thanks to its subject, the way it was advertised and the talent involved) for a long time but not having the time due to heavy music and music college work commitments and being behind with my &quot;must-see&quot; list. \n\nMy thoughts were that it is a beautiful and courageous film that won&apos;t be, and clearly isn&apos;t judging from the polarising user review opinions here, everybody&apos;s cup of tea, but is a sensitive and emotionally powerful portrayal of a subject matter that&apos;s important, very much relevant (even more so now) and controversial. It takes a lot of guts to portray this subject in any form and &apos;The Danish Girl&apos; acquits itself beautifully if not perfectly. \n\n&apos;The Danish Girl&apos; to me is not without its imperfections. It does drag a little at times and trimming 10-15 minutes off the running time would have helped it perhaps. The script, while mostly thought-provoking and sensitive, has instances where it&apos;s too lightweight and needed a tightening up and could have been bolder and take more risks. \n\nSo much works though. &apos;The Danish Girl&apos; looks gorgeous, like an art painting come to life, especially the landscapes and sumptuous period detail. The costumes are evocative and pleasing on the eyes and the whole film is beautifully photographed. Alexandre Desplat&apos;s score is one of his most hypnotic and enchanting and Tom Hooper&apos;s direction is perhaps him at his most subtle and understated. \n\nIt, in terms of writing and story, is mostly thought-provoking and treats the subject matter with an honesty, sensitivity and a big emotional wallop. There are instances such as the ending where the film did bring tears to my eyes. \n\nCan&apos;t say anything bad about the performances. Eddie Redmayne is the top-billed star and he does give a very deeply felt and courageous turn. Oddly enough though Gerda is actually the focus, where her complex feelings are ones that anybody in her position would relate to. Alicia Vikander&apos;s performance is truly sensational and her chemistry with Redmayne is also one where it is clear they&apos;re in love with each other. All the supporting cast are strong, my favourite being the sympathetic one of Matthias Schoenaerts.\n\nAll in all, beautiful and brave film but not for all. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

This movie has a taste of both and it is not boring or uninteresting at all. Loved it and will totally see it again, if only for the music. Loved the acting and thought Mr. Martel is coming into his own very well. Cannot wait to see what he is in next!",

Didn&apos;t realise how much I missed watching her in films.\n\nEveryone else - all amazing, all did a brilliant job.\n\nThe writing was spot on, though the theme was pretty dark the comedic moments came in at the right time. There were some parts where it dragged a little but it soon picked back up. There were nice little nuances throughout that captured each character.\n\nWith such a big cast of absolute talent it felt like there was a danger the film wouldn&apos;t find the balance for all their stories, but it does and just shows the skill of the director and editors.\n\nA poignant look at what our reactions might be to such a disaster, indeed what our reactions are right now when faced with a choice between believing scientific facts and verbal garbage from political blowhards and tech giant psychos who have no idea what they&apos;re doing.\n\nSatire at its best.\n\nOnce the credits hit make sure you hang around. There&apos;s a clip near the start of them and one right at the end.",
